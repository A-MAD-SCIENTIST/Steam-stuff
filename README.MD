# Steam Chat Dark Mode (Metro)

THIS IS A CHAT MOD ONLY, NOT A WHOLE CLIENT RESKIN, u can try metro and pair with this, works excellent. :)

tbh this will be obsolete eventually but AFAIK, metro doesn't have the chat skin (YET)

## Getting Started

Firstly download the EnableNewSteamFriendsSkin in the repository. twust me it safe i wont be after your bitcoins :) 
OR RUN IN A SANDBOX ENVIRONMENT GODDAMNIT IF U THINK IT'S BAD. wat.

-  A quick scan on the .exe via VirusTotal shows  [this](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/0e29aea0e9e21f4549e219f27cd6652440558c708df5ecc35305e4dece430f41/detection). 




### Prerequisites

```
A Windows PC, 7 or above, Steam and full Administrator rights to the system.

```

### Installing

Anyway, now download the "friends.custom.css" (MAKE SURE U HAVEN'T RAN THE EXE YET), then place that .css file in: 


```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\clientui
```


## Running the software

So now make sure steam is open and logged in. Run the .exe, accept M$'s crappy protection thingy. Follow the instructions in the Window,

u may have to delete cached files, which the software will tell u to do anyway.

Once the program says it's done, relaunch steam and your friends list is gonna spaz out, bascially, just hit connect on the friends window
and it should be fine :)

### Troubleshooting:

My friends aren't showing!
```
Just click on group chats to fix it. You should not have to do this again.
```

### How to uninstall

```
Remove friends.custom.css from C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\clientui

Run SteamFriendsPatcher.exe and clear cache.
```
