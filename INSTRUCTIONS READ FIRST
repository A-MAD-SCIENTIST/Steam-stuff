THIS IS A CHAT MOD ONLY, NOT A WHOLE CLIENT RESKIN, u can try metro and pair with this, works excellent :)


Firstly download the EnableNewSteamFriendsSkin in the repository. twust me it safe i wont be after your bitcoins :) 
OR RUN IN A SANDBOX ENVIROMENT GODDAMNIT IF U THINK IT'S BAD. wat.

Anyway, now download the "friends.custom.css" (MAKE SURE U HAVEN'T RAN THE EXE YET), then place that .css file in: 

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\clientui

So now make sure steam is open and logged in. Run the .exe, accept M$'s crappy protection thingy. Follow the instructions in the Window,

u may have to delete cached files, which the software will tell u to do anyway.

Once the program says it's done, relaunch steam and your friends list is gonna spaz out, bascially, just hit connect on the friends window
and it should be fine :)



TO UNINSTALL:

Remove friends.custom.css from C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\clientui
